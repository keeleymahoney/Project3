      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Keeley Mahoney and I am a junior Computer Science Major with minors in Mathematics and Engineering Project Management. I am graduating in the Fall of 2025 and I attend Texas A&M University. On campus, I am involved in Student Engineer's Council and FEST. Additionally, I volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club of Brazos Valley.</p>
        <p> I am a hardworking, dedicated student who enjoys growth and learning. I have had two previous 
          internships, and currently am planning on working at Clarity Partners as a Software Engineer
          Intern in the summer in Chicago, Illinois.
