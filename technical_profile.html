      <h2><a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNA8B4KH_gw>Project 1 - Connect 4</a></h2>
      <div class = "techprofile">
        <p>I created a Connect 4 game utilizing Java and Java FX to create a GUI game board. 
            The project was created for my CSCE 314 class, and it was completed as a solo project. 
            The user had the option to play against random AI, or smart AI, in which the game competitively 
            thought about its next move. I coded the algorithm that the smart AI utilized to make these choices. 
            Additionally, the user could restart or save the game at any point. When saving a game, the program 
            saved a text file that logged all of the moves by both the computer and the player. The user also 
            had the option to load a game, in which the user would enter in the location of the text log of the 
            game they wanted to load into the game, and the game would replicate those moves.

      <h2>Project 2 - Website Automation </h2>
      <div class = "techprofile">
        <p>I completed this project for Wintrust, located in Rosemont, Illinois as a part of my summer internship. 
            For this project, I utilized UiPath to automate two processes for the Credit sector of Wintrust. The first
            process automated a once manual process that updated users' information on a website. The second process
            helped to open new accounts for new customers, which was also previously a manual process. I was responsible 
            for the Project Requirements for this process, writing the code from beginning to end, and helping to ensure 
            that implementation was successful for the automation to run weekly on its own.

      <h2>Project 3 - Minesweeper </h2>
      <div class = "techprofile">
        <p>For this project, I utilized Java and Java FX to recreate a minesweeper game. The user began by
            clicking a square, and then various squares would be revealed with the number of bombs adjacent to 
            each square. Once the user clicked on a bomb, the game was over. I created an algorithm that would
            reveal a certain number of squares when the user would click on a space. Additionally, I utilized 
            a 2D array to keep track of the number of bombs adjacent to each square.
