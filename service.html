          <p>The LeaderShop is a nonprofit organization that helps out the local community of LaGrange, Illinois.
                They work to create leaders out of those who serve and create a community of thoughtful, caring individuals.
                As a volunteer I served as a summer camp counselor, teen leader, Board Member, tutor, and leader.

          <p>BEDS is a community organization that provides services to local homeless individuals. They provide
            food, housing, connect them to jobs, and create a community. In the summer of 2020, I volunteered
            as a grocery distributor for BEDS. Each week, I would get the groceries from the BEDS facilities
            and then spend the next 1-2 hours delivering the groceries to the individuals who required it. It 
            was a great way to give back during COVID.

        <div class = "service-info">
        
          <p>I have been a Girl Scout since Kindergarten. Through Girl Scouts, I have participated in a lot
              of volunteer projects. But, one of the most meaningful ones is my Girl Scout Gold Award. This project
              is an individual service project that Girl Scouts complete to help their local community. For my project,
              I wanted to focus on helping out girls and women in STEM, as it was a cause that I cared a lot about.
              I first went to around 12 Girl meetings and introduced the girls to various STEM projects that allowed
              them to combine their interests with something tangible. I also hosted a panel of local women who are
              in the STEM field to talk about their jobs and their journey in their career. It was a great way to 
              connect with my local community and do something for a cause that I care about.

        <div class = "service-info">
          
          <p>I started volunteering at the Boys and Girls Club of Brazos Valley in the Fall of 2023. The 
                Boys and Girls Club works to provide a community for local boys and girls. They host a variety of
                events, such as an after school program, various sporting events, and workshops. I volunteer at
                the after school program. I really enjoy the connections that I have made with the students that
                I work with and am excited to see what the future holds.

        <div class = "service-info">
          
          <p>Aggies Read is a group on campus at Texas A&M that promotes literacy. One of the ways this group
                accomplishes it is through going into local schools and working with teachers to read to students,
                help out in the classroom, or assist students with their homework. I would go to Southwood Valley
                Elementary School each week and help students with their math and reading. I really enjoyed seeing
                the growth of the students I worked with.

        <div class = "service-info">
          
          <p>The 12th Can is an on campus food pantry that works to eliminate hunger in the Texas A&M Community.
                Each month, the 12th Can hosts four openings for students, staff and faculty to pick out groceries.
                Volunteers work to check in clients, stock the pantry, and ensure that everything is running smoothly.
                I really enjoyed seeing the impact that this work was making on the lives of the local community.

          <p>STRIDES is a nonprofit organization that works to provide scholarships for students with disabilities
                to attend Texas A&M through the PATHS and Achieve programs. This organization was the philanthropy
                of my FLO, FEST. We hold an annual volleyball tournament to raise money for STRIDES, held bake sales, 
                collected money from relatives, and met with STRIDES representatives often. I loved knowing that
                all of our hard work was going towards a good cause.
